        "description": "I have used timeshift since nearly the first release back in 2017 and it has saved me from disaster several times.\n\nIt is truly a program written with the spirit of UNIX in mind. It does one thing and it does it well. It lets you restore your operating system files and configuration to a previous state in a simple and reliable way. Set it up and forget it until the day you need it. You will be glad you did!\n\nI use timeshift the same way on all my computers which run Linux. I set it up to write the snapshots to a fast micro-SD card or a fast but tiny USB3 flash drive. As the amount of data to be backed up is not huge, even just 32GB is enough at a pinch. \n\nUsing a separate device to store the snapshots means I can even survive a failure on the operating system disk, as timeshift can restore the most recent snapshot and even re-install the bootloader to a new disk.\n\nAs explained on the github project page, timeshift is for backing up and restoring your system files, not user files, so you should make other arrangements for them.\n\nTop tip - always set up some \"on boot\" snapshots. If you install some updates and they mess up your system, you can always restore from the previous \"on boot\" backup to be up and running again in minutes. \n\nMy sincere thanks to the author for a great program.",
